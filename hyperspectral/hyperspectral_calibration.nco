We take WD = 2 m. Focal length (about 25 mm) is ignored in this estimate because it is much smaller than the WD. The camera geometry implies that AFOV[degrees]=2*atan(HFOV/WD). We use AFOV=21 and 44.6 degress for SWIR and VNIR, respectively. Then we solve for HFOV, and that distance is equally apportioned to 384 or 1600 pixels for SWIR or VNIR, respectively.

     Camera exposed to natural light reflecting from reference target for standard exposure time accumulates exposure_reference counts in each channel
     Expected to be large fraction (assumed here to be factory_calibrated_reflectance_guesstimate) of exposure_theoretical_maximum for white reflector 
     However, grey reference reflector might be more optimal than white
     Plants have maximum reflectance of ~0.4 so calibrating at white (~0.95) not as accurate as calibrating near 0.4 
     We hope Lemnatec tunes exposure time to achieve the greatest dynamic range, and thus precision, under a wide range of circumstances
     One tuning consideration is that maximum exposure for white reflector at noon is close to but does not exceed exposure_theoretical_maximum 
     Other tuning considerations are possible... */
