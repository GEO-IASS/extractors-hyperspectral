# Hyperspectral extractors

This repository contains extractors that process data originating from:
- Hyperspec INSPECTOR SWIR camera
- Hyperspec INSPECTOR VNIR camera


### Hyperspectral extractor
This extractor processes HDF files into netCDF. 

_Input_

  - Evaluation is triggered whenever a file is added to a dataset
  - Checks whether the file is a _raw file
  
_Output_

  - The dataset containing the _raw file will get a corresponding .nc netCDF file

## Scripts:

1. CalculationWorks.py

A supporting module for EnvironmentalLoggerAnalyser.py and JsonDealer.py.
This module is in charge of all the calculation works needed in the
EnvironmentalLoggerAnalyser.py (converting the data made by environmental logger)
and JsonDealer.py (group up the supporting files for data_raw).

* EnvironmentalLoggerAnalyzer.py

This module will read data generated by Environmental Sensor and convert to netCDF file

* JsonDealer.py

This module parses JSON formatted metadata and data and header provided by LemnaTec and outputs a formatted netCDF4 file

* DataProcess.py

This module will process the data file and export a netCDF with variables 
from it and dimesions (band, x, y) from its hdr file

* terraref.nco

NCO/ncap2 script to process and calibrate TERRAREF exposure data
